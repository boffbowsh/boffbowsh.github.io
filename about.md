I’m a polyglot Software Engineer and Architect with an operations mindset. I’m a technical leader and mentor, and specialise in scaling and optimising technical teams. I enjoy tackling technical debt in legacy applications. I like scaling systems and eking out every last bit of performance. I work well with product people and explain technical concepts clearly for non technical staff.
