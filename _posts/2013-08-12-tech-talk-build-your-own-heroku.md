title: "Tech Talk: Build Your Own Heroku"
---

The globaldev team is gradually becoming more polyglot, and is constantly
churning out more supporting applications to help run our platform. Deploying
all these apps the "old fashioned way" provides a big headache for our
Operations team. Luckily, the industry is moving more and more towards
containerised PaaS-style deployment such as that used by Heroku. 

In this talk I discuss how companies that aren't on the absolute bleeding edge
of the Linux kernel can still leverage these patterns on their private
infrastructure, even when fantastic projects like Docker won't run on their
hardware. I also provide a preview of the technology that will be backing
Griddle when it is released. Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
