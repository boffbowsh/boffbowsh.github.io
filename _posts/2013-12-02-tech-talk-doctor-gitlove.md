...or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Git Rebase

In this talk I give some insight into how Git works under-the-hood, so next
time you find yourself in some horrible rebase state it's not so scary; you
know where it's actually stuck. I explore the different types of object used
within git's database and how they all link together to form your git history.
